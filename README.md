Advent of Code Solutions Repo

I've taken part in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) since 2021.

Since each problem has two parts the repo is structured so there is one folder per day per year. That is:

```
- year
    - day_01
        - part1.py
        - part2.py
```

It's frowned upon to post personal inputs. Every solution I write relies on an ignored file ('input.txt'), this is where you should copy your own personal input for testing.
